(assuming you have python\numpy\matplotlib installed: install the modules beforehand)
1. download as a zip and unzip to desired location
2. copy the main absolute path
3. run 'python _mains absolute path_ --lower --stemming --shortwords --stopwords --visualization' in cmd
   
# commands
The different commands are 

lower: which lower cases all incoming tokens   
stemming: which removes the most common prefixes and suffixes in all incoming tokens  
shortwords: remove all words shorter than 3 characters long  
stopwords: removes all most common stopwords from the tokens  
visualization: creates a log py plot of the top 100 tokens, (this is because the amount of tokens is to large to handle)  

# notes
if there is an issue running the commands in python let me know
